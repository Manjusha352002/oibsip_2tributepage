                <h2>Social Reformer</h2>
                <p>
                  <b>Savitribai Phule </b> was an Indian social reformer, educationalist, and poet from Maharashtra. Along with her husband, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule in Maharashtra, she played an important and vital role in improving women's rights in India. She is considered to be the pioneer of India's feminist movement. Savitribai and her husband founded one of the early modern Indian girls' school in Pune, at Bhide wada in 1848. Robert May of the London Missionary Society was the first person to open a school exclusively for girls in the region of Chinsurah, Bengal, in 1818. She worked to abolish the discrimination and unfair treatment of people based on caste and gender.
